This is the first full project I start with the Odin Project, on the use of HTML.
After struggling  a bit before with the old curriculum - the freecodecamp focused one - I am excited to try the new approach out and hopefully get out of the foundation stagnation onto deeper concepts. 

Will use this as a journal for my progress with the project.

Let's start this!
