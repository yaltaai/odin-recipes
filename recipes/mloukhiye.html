    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil a whole chicken in a large pot (add in a quartered onion for aroma), filling the water more than half way (about 12 cups). <br>
            Allow to boil on low heat, covered for 40 minutes. <br>
            Drain into a bowl to sift the chicken broth, then set chicken aside to cool.  Once cooled remove the chicken meat off the bones and<br>
            break apart.  Set aside.</li><br>
        <li>In the meantime, pick out the leaves from any dirt and place them in a large bowl, throwing out long stems and yellow leaves.  <br>
            Throw away the remaining little crushed leaves.  Wash the leaves in a colander very well using warm water. <br>
            Place back in the large bowl, add warm water and allow to sit for 1/2 hour then drain using a colander. Repeat washing about 5 times. </li><br>
        <li>In the same large pot you boiled the chicken in, add olive oil, minced garlic, half the amount of chopped cilantro and saute’ <br>
            on high heat for about a minute. <br> Add in the washed Mloukhieh leaves and continue to sauté for another 5 minutes.   </li><br>
        <li>Add in the chicken, the chicken broth to cover the Mloukhieh, coriander, seven spices, Kamooni OR cumin, lemon, bouillon cubes and mix. <br>
            Add in the remaining fresh minced cilantro.<br><br>
            Cover and set on simmer for 20 minutes.  Enjoy over steamed white rice topped with cayenne pepper, chopped cilantro and more lemon juice! </li><br>
