    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 large (1 1/2 - 2 pounds) potatoes , peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>8 tbsp (1/2 cup) butter</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
        <li>1-2 cups vegetables—diced carrots, corn, peas</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground round beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Salt, pepper, other seasonings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. Cover with at least an inch of cold water.<br>
            Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).</li><br>
        <li>While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tbsp of the butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat.<br> 
            Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.<br><br>
            If you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions,<br>
            because they take as long to cook as the onions do.<br><br>
            If you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook,<br>
            as they take very little cooking time.</li><br>
        <li>Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper. <br><br>
            Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes,<br>
            adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.</li><br>
        <li>When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining <br>
            4 Tbsp of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li><br>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (9x13 casserole).<br>
            Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef.<br><br>
            Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the<br>
             surface of the mashed potatoes brown.</li><br>
    </ol>
