 <h2> Ingredients </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 tsp (optional)</li>
        <li>3-4 whole eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.)</li><br>
        <li>While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large saut√© pan over medium heat. <br><br>
             Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy. Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, <br>
             then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.</li><br>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.</li><br>
        <li>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.</li><br>
        <li>When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon <br>
            and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water. <br> <br>

            Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta <br>
            that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce. <br> <br>
            
            Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when<br>
             you mix them in.(That's the tricky part.)</li>
    </ol>
